# Moneymile

## Directions
The goal is simple. Let's see how far you can go with a Ride Sharing application!  Give us a the dollar amount you're willing to spend from where you are. We will provide you a visual representation of distance based on your dollar amount.
```
* Uber API
* Ride Sharing Scooter companies
* Bike sharing companies
* Bus/Bart transit
```

## Compliance with Uber 
This application will comply to Uber's price estimates `Terms of Use`.  Our application will require an upfront fare and will respect the rights and privacy of Uber and their Drivers. No data will be stored and/or used to compete with Uber services and there is no intention of reselling the services offered by Uber. 

## Current chores
```
* Project refactor to separate api concerns to node server.
* Refactor UI with Redux or Sagas and follow SRP with reusable components
* Styled components
* Set up React Proptypes
* Fix boundaries algorithm when estimates hit water
```

## Project Status
Visual distance estimating project continuation.
Utilize Heroku pipelines for continued development. Set up Jest tests and fix water boundary bugs with Google Maps API.

# How to use

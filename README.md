# purlieu.io

Example of React application with webpack from scratch without `create-react-app`. 
Built with an Express Node.js server with demonstrations with Node concurrency patterns interacting with React Sagas patterns. 



*Note, Lyft developer API maintains a strict request limit. If hexagonal projection is faulty (usually a perfect hexagon), try refreshing the page or try again later.

## Security 
This application is vulnerable and surfaces an API key when making a server request. The client mixes logic that should belong in the server. This was made only for learning purposes.

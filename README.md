# Moneymile

## Directions
We want to incorporate various ride sharing API's and allow users to receive a visual distance estimate based on a dollar amount. Due to API request limits, we may want to develop an algorithm to store estimates based on time, distance, and time of year.
```
* Uber API
* Ride Sharing Scooter companies
* Bike sharing companies
* Bus/Bart transit
```

## Current chores
```
* Project refactor to separate api concerns to node server.
* Refactor UI with Redux or Sagas and follow SRP with reusable components
* Styled components
* Set up React Proptypes
* Fix boundaries algorithm when estimates hit water
```

## Project Status
Visual distance estimating project continuation.
Utilize Heroku pipelines for continued development. Set up Jest tests and fix water boundary bugs with Google Maps API.

# How to use
```
yarn
yarn dev
yarn watch
